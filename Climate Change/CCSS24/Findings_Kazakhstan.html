            <h2 class="section-title">COUNTRY OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                The Republic of Kazakhstan is a landlocked country and the ninth largest country in the world by area.
                Located in Central Asia, the country shares borders with the Russian Federation to the north, China to
                the east, and Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic to the south. The Caspian Sea forms a
                natural boundary to the west. Kazakhstan contains forest-steppe, steppe, semi-arid, and desert climate
                zones, and precipitation is low throughout. Kazakhstan has one of the lowest population densities in the
                world, with a population of 20 million (2024) spread over its 2.7 million square kilometer area, and 57%
                of this population lives in urban areas.
                <br><br>
                Kazakhstan’s economy is dominated by a large minerals sector. This includes oil and gas (which accounted
                for 21% of GDP and 62% of exports in 2017), uranium (of which Kazakhstan is the world’s largest
                producer), and other metals. The service sector accounted for 54.2% of Kazakhstan's GDP, while the
                agriculture sector's share was 4.8%. The industrial sector, including mining and manufacturing,
                contributed 27.7% to the GDP.
                <br><br>
                Kazakhstan is classified as an upper-middle-income country. The GDP per capita has continued to grow,
                reaching $13,276.70 in 2023, compared to $11,476.60 in 2022. This reflects ongoing economic development,
                though the growth rate has varied in recent years due to external factors such as global economic
                conditions and regional geopolitical events.

            <p class="section-content">
                Flat or rolling terrain predominates throughout much of Kazakhstan, with lowlands accounting for one
                third of the country’s total area and low mountains a further fifth. The exceptions to this topography
                are the very low-lying areas by the Caspian Sea in the west, and Altay mountains that reach altitudes of
                7,000 meters (m) on the eastern border with China and the Kyrgyz Republic. Kazakhstan experiences an
                extreme continental climate, with long, hot summers and cold winters. Winter in the north of the country
                is long and cold – in some years the temperatures reached -52°C (Astana), but there are also thaws up to
                5°C. The shortest season in the north is spring, which lasts 1.5 months, while summer lasts 3 months and
                winter extends from October to April. Snow primarily falls in November but can continue through April.
                Kazakhstan’s seasonal climate cycle for the latest climatology, 1991–2020, is shown in Figure 2.

            <p class ="section-content">
                Due to its great distance from the ocean, Kazakhstan has a highly continental climate and large intraday and 
                annual fluctuations in temperature. This means that temperatures in the winter months (December to February) 
                are extremely cold, with national averages between −9°C and −12°C, whereas summers are hot, with average 
                temperatures of 22°C to 23°C in June, July and August. Precipitation is low throughout the year, with average 
                monthly levels of between 14 millimeters (mm) and 30 mm, although flooding can occur during spring due to 
                increased rain and the thawing of winter snow. Temperatures throughout the year vary with latitude in Kazakhstan, 
                with northern areas experiencing much colder winter temperatures than southern areas, and southern areas 
                relatively hot summers. This means that in January and February temperatures in the capital (Astana, in the 
                north of the country) can fall to −16°C, while in the most populous city (Almaty, in the southeast) average
                 temperatures remain above−7°C. Similarly, the average temperature in July can vary from 20°C in parts of the 
                 north and northeast to 29°C in southern areas near the border with Uzbekistan. Levels of precipitation can vary 
                 significantly between climate zones. Desert areas, such as the central Betpak Dala desert and the southern Kyzylkum desert, 
                 receive only 100–200 mm of precipitation per annum, whereas steppe areas receive 200–500 mm per year. Precipitation in the 
                 foothills and mountains vary between 500 and 1,600 mm per annum. Figure 3 shows observed spatial variation for temperature 
                 and precipitation across Kazakhstan.

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Key Impacts of Climate Change in Kazakhstan</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
        <strong>Temperature Rise</strong><br>
        <br>
        Over the past few decades, Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in average temperatures, with a trend consistent with global warming patterns. Between 1941 and 2023, the average temperature increased by approximately 0.28°C per decade. This warming is more pronounced in the northern, western, and southern regions, particularly during the autumn and winter months, with temperature rises of 0.32°C and 0.35°C per decade, respectively. In contrast, summer temperatures have risen by 0.18°C per decade. This trend is expected to continue, leading to hotter summers and milder winters, which will have extensive impacts on the country's natural and economic systems.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Water Resources</strong><br>
        <br>
        Climate change is critically affecting Kazakhstan's water resources, essential for agriculture, industry, and human consumption. The Tien Shan and Altai glaciers, which feed major rivers like the Syr Darya and Irtysh, are retreating. This reduction in glacier mass leads to decreased river flows, significantly impacting agricultural regions that rely on irrigation. The drying of major lakes such as Lake Balkhash exacerbates desertification and dust storms, affecting approximately one-fifth of the population living in its basin. In the medium-term, increased glacier melt may lead to flooding, but long-term, reduced glacier mass will lower river flow rates, threatening agricultural sustainability and increasing regional water stress due to transboundary water dependencies.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Agriculture</strong><br>
        <br>
        Kazakhstan's agricultural sector, a vital part of its economy, is highly vulnerable to climate variability. Changes in precipitation patterns, increased drought frequency, and extreme weather events threaten crop yields and livestock. For example, wheat yields, which are critical to Kazakhstan's economy, are expected to decline by 20%-50% by the 2050s without adaptation measures due to higher temperatures and reduced soil moisture. Adaptation strategies include introducing drought-resistant crop varieties and improving irrigation practices. These measures are crucial for maintaining agricultural productivity and food security in the face of climate change.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Desertification and Land Degradation</strong><br>
        <br>
        Desertification and land degradation are significant challenges in Kazakhstan, exacerbated by climate change. Overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable land management contribute to soil erosion and loss of arable land, especially in the southern and western regions. Increased temperatures and decreased precipitation worsen soil salinity and desertification risks, particularly in transition zones between grassland and desert. Dust storms, which are already common, further degrade land and contribute to soil erosion, negatively impacting agriculture and living conditions.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Biodiversity</strong><br>
        <br>
        Climate change poses severe risks to Kazakhstan's rich biodiversity. Shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns affect ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Species unable to adapt quickly to these changes face extinction threats. For instance, changes in water availability and habitat conditions can drastically affect both flora and fauna. Conservation efforts are critical to maintaining ecological balance and protecting biodiversity against the adverse effects of climate change.

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Mitigation and Adaptation Efforts</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
        <strong>Renewable Energy</strong><br>
        <br>
        Kazakhstan is investing in renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The government aims to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. For instance, large-scale solar farms and wind energy projects are being developed to harness the country's vast renewable energy potential.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Sustainable Land Management</strong><br>
        <br>
        Efforts to promote sustainable land management practices are underway to combat desertification and improve soil health. These include afforestation, reforestation, and conservation agriculture techniques. For example, projects focusing on planting drought-resistant trees and adopting soil conservation methods help to restore degraded lands and prevent further desertification.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Water Management</strong><br>
        <br>
        Improved water management strategies are critical to address challenges posed by shrinking glaciers and changing precipitation patterns. Efficient irrigation systems, water-saving technologies, and integrated water resource management plans are essential components of these efforts. The government is implementing policies to enhance water use efficiency and promote sustainable water practices, such as modernizing irrigation infrastructure and encouraging the use of water-saving agricultural techniques.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Climate Policy</strong><br>
        <br>
        Kazakhstan has developed national strategies and action plans to address climate change, demonstrating its commitment to international agreements like the Paris Agreement. These policies aim to reduce carbon emissions and enhance climate resilience through comprehensive measures, including improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, and implementing climate-adaptive agricultural practices. The government is also focused on fostering regional cooperation to manage transboundary water resources effectively.
