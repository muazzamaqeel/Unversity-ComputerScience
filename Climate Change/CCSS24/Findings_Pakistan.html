        <!-- Key Impacts of Climate Change in Pakistan -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Key Impacts of Climate Change in Pakistan</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                <strong>Temperature Rise</strong><br>
                <br>
                Pakistan has experienced a significant rise in average temperatures over the past few decades, consistent with global warming trends. Between 1951 and 2023, the average temperature in Pakistan increased by approximately 0.26°C per decade. The warming trend is more pronounced in the northern and central regions, particularly during the summer months. This has resulted in longer and more intense heatwaves, which impact human health, agriculture, and water resources. Projections indicate that temperatures will continue to rise, leading to more extreme weather events and further stressing Pakistan’s natural and economic systems.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Water Resources</strong><br>
                <br>
                Climate change poses a severe threat to Pakistan’s water resources, which are vital for agriculture, industry, and domestic use. The country relies heavily on the Indus River system, fed by glaciers in the Himalayas and the Karakoram. These glaciers are retreating due to rising temperatures, reducing the flow of rivers and impacting water availability. Seasonal variations in river flows, coupled with increased demand from a growing population, exacerbate water stress. Flooding during the monsoon season and droughts during dry periods further strain water resources. Effective water management is crucial to address these challenges and ensure sustainable water use.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Agriculture</strong><br>
                <br>
                Pakistan’s agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to climate variability and change. Changes in precipitation patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and rising temperatures threaten crop yields and livestock. Wheat, rice, and cotton, which are critical to Pakistan’s economy, are particularly affected. Projections suggest that wheat yields could decline by up to 30% by 2050 without adaptation measures. Adaptation strategies include introducing drought-resistant crop varieties, improving irrigation practices, and adopting climate-smart agricultural techniques. These measures are essential for maintaining agricultural productivity and food security in the face of climate change.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Desertification and Land Degradation</strong><br>
                <br>
                Desertification and land degradation are significant challenges in Pakistan, exacerbated by climate change and unsustainable land management practices. Overgrazing, deforestation, and improper agricultural practices contribute to soil erosion and loss of fertile land, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions. Increased temperatures and decreased precipitation worsen soil salinity and desertification risks. Dust storms, which are common in the Thar Desert and other arid areas, further degrade land and negatively impact agriculture and living conditions. Sustainable land management practices are necessary to combat these issues and restore degraded lands.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Biodiversity</strong><br>
                <br>
                Climate change poses a threat to Pakistan’s rich biodiversity, affecting ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns disrupt the natural habitats of many species, leading to shifts in their distribution and behavior. Species unable to adapt to these changes face increased extinction risks. Wetlands, forests, and coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable. Conservation efforts, including protected areas and wildlife corridors, are critical to preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance.

Large-scale solar projects in the Thar Desert and wind farms in Sindh and Balochistan are part of these efforts. Promoting renewable energy is crucial for sustainable development and combating climate change.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Sustainable Land Management</strong><br>
                <br>
                Efforts to promote sustainable land management practices are underway to combat desertification and improve soil health. These include afforestation, reforestation, and conservation agriculture techniques. Projects focusing on planting drought-resistant trees, adopting soil conservation methods, and restoring degraded lands are being implemented. These initiatives help to prevent further land degradation and support sustainable agriculture.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Water Management</strong><br>
                <br>
                Improved water management strategies are critical to addressing the challenges posed by climate change. Efficient irrigation systems, water-saving technologies, and integrated water resource management plans are essential components of these efforts. The government is implementing policies to enhance water use efficiency, promote sustainable water practices, and modernize irrigation infrastructure. Managing transboundary water resources through regional cooperation is also a priority to ensure water security.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Climate Policy</strong><br>
                <br>
                Pakistan has developed national strategies and action plans to address climate change, demonstrating its commitment to international agreements like the Paris Agreement. These policies aim to reduce carbon emissions and enhance climate resilience through comprehensive measures. Key actions include improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, and implementing climate-adaptive agricultural practices. The government is also focused on fostering regional cooperation to manage shared water resources effectively and mitigate climate impacts.
